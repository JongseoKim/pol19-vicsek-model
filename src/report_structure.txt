#structure of our report

Introduction
	Motility assay (biological description, why is this important for humankind :), whicch observations have been made)
	Computational approach to understand the motility assay
Viszek model
	general ideasos this model: assumptions
	importance of the Viszek model
	why can we use this model for the motility assay? how does the biological structure fit the assumptions in the model?
Our work
	cell-by-cell evaluation vs normal evaluation
		time plot (time needed by the programm with and without cell-by-cell evaluation depending on particle number)
	phase space
	parameter dependencies we have found
	do our results confirm the paper
Evaluation/results
	summary of the aspects we found
Appendix
	written code
	work done by the team members
	citations of papers!
