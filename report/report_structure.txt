#structure of our report

Introduction
	Motility assay (biological description, why is this important for humankind/biophysics :), which observations have been made)
		nematic lines vs polar lines --> what is the difference?
	Computational approach to understand the motility assay: how can the motility assay be described mathematically? which assumptions can we make?
Vicsek model
	general ideasos this model: assumptions
	importance of the Vicsek model
	why can we use this model for the motility assay? how does the biological structure fit the assumptions in the model?
Our work - ideas for the evaluation
Evaluation/results
	-> summary of the aspects we found
	phase space
	parameter dependencies we have found
	find critical density, above which there are density waves and other interesting behaviour, below this critical density we do not get any fancy behaviour of the assay 
	do our results confirm the results of the papers? (Discussion I)
Comparison Vicsek/our results to Frey et al. papers (Discussion II)
    what do they have in common? what is different?
    universality classes and scaling parameters
    stability of nematic/polar phases
    paradigm change: universality (2010) vs. dynamic emergence of order (2018)?
